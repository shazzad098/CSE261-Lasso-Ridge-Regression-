📊 Lasso vs Ridge Regression using Gradient Descent

This repository contains a comparative implementation of Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression using Gradient Descent, created for the CSE261 course assignment. It demonstrates how Lasso drives some coefficients to zero (feature selection) and contrasts it with Ridge’s coefficient shrinkage.

📚 Assignment Overview

- Course: CSE261
- Topic: Implement and explain Lasso Regression using Gradient Descent
- Goal: Show how Lasso drives some coefficients to zero and compare with Ridge Regression

🧠 Key Concepts

- Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
- Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
- Gradient Descent Optimization
- Coefficient shrinkage and feature selection

🚀 How to Run
